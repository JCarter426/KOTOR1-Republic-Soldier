| Title:   | JC's Republic Soldier Fix for K1       |
| Version: | 1.4.0                                  |
| Game:    | Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic |

This mod improves the Republic soldier models. Texture mapping errors on the male model are corrected, and the female model is replaced with a higher-quality one based on the male model.

Additionally, there is an option to replace the player clothing models with Republic soldier armor.


# Installation

1. Copy all files from the Override folder to your game's Override folder. If you do not already have an Override folder, make one.


### Player Clothing

If you would like to replace player clothing with Republic soldier armor, copy files from the Player Clothing folder to your game's Override folder. If you want to replace clothing for all player classes, copy all files. If you want to replace clothing only for a specific class, copy only the files containing the letter corresponding to the class you want:

| --------- | - |
| Soldier   | L |
| Scout     | M |
| Scoundrel | S |


# Uninstallation

1. Remove all installed files.


# Compatibility

This mod changes the texture mapping of the female Republic soldier armor model to be the same as the male model. That means this mod will not be compatible with mods which edit the **female** texture, `N_RepSold_F01`, but it will be compatible with mods which edit the **male** texture, `N_RepSold01`, and that can be applied to all Republic soldier armors regardless of gender. Replace all TPC files installed by this mod with copies of the other mod's `N_RepSold01` texture.
